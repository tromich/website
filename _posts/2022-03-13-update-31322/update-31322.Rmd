title: "Update 3/13/22"
description: |
  I've made substantial updates to the website. A pdf of my resume is now available, and the project portfolio page contains links to three data manipulation and analysis projects I've done for coursework. A fourth one will be added tomorrow. Some photos will be added to the Death Valley Photos page tomorrow as well, if time permits.
