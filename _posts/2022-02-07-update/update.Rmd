  I'm in the process of building this website. It's a lot harder to find online help related to this process than I thought it would be - in particular, I am struggling to find anything related to how to add or manipulate images on webpages designed in Rstudio. As a result, the main page image is still sideways. I've updated the 'about' page with some more detailed information about me - it will likely turn into a CV/resume eventually, but may be split into two pages at that point. I think it would be cool to add some photos I've taken in Death Valley to a page by themselves.
