      "description": "I am a Geography Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Currently, I am researching the impacts of climate on conifer needle shedding, using the RHESSys ecohydrological model. I completed my Master's degree in Geography at UC Santa Barbara in 2020, after finishing a study on the impact of solar radiation on decomposition of common California grass species. Prior to attending graduate school, I worked seasonal jobs related to natural resources management for several years, in a variety of ecosystems. I completed my undergraduate degree in Science of Earth Systems at Cornell University in 2013.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy hiking, a passion that dates to childhood and that has inspired me to work in natural resources and conservation. In recent years I have made several trips to Death Valley with my family.\n",
